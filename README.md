# Forms
Microverse Ruby on Rails Project No.5 [Forms]

This is part of the Forms Project in The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at http://www.theodinproject.com


# Setup
You can setup this project by;
#### Either Cloning it
git clone git@github.com:lucasmazo32/re-former.git
#### Or downloading the Zipped file from
https://github.com/lucasmazo32/re-former.git

## Before you start

- Remember to run "bundle install" in your terminal. In case of an error run "bundle update".
- Afterwards, run "rails db:create" and "rails db:migrate" on your terminal.
- We have a cool gem! To use it, run the rails console typing "rails c" in your terminal and when it loads type in the first line "Hirb.enable", it will return true if everything is working. Now you can see the tables of the database!
- Following the instructions of the Odin project, we only created the routes for editing and creating (new, edit, create, and update) and we didn't change the path, thus the only working paths are "/users/new" and "/users/:id/edit".
- The root rout gives you the list of the user's username and email, so you can have a visual aid for the user's information without having to rely on the rails console.
